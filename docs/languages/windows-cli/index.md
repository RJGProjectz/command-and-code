# CMD (Windows Command Prompt)

Native Windows command-line tools (`cmd.exe` built-ins and executables in `System32`): `netstat`, `tasklist`, `sc.exe`, `schtasks`, `reg`, `wevtutil`, `auditpol`, `icacls`, `netsh`, `whoami`, `gpresult`, `w32tm`.

These are still essential: they work in `cmd.exe`, in restricted shells, in EDR live-response consoles that do not load PowerShell modules, and on systems where PowerShell is constrained.

!!! warning "Calling them from PowerShell"
    Always include `.exe` for tools whose names collide with PowerShell aliases — `sc.exe`, not `sc`. Native tools signal failure through `$LASTEXITCODE`, not exceptions; see [error handling](../powershell/error-handling.md#native-executables).
